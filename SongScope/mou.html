            [Verse]
            Ow!
            You the one that said you were doin' it
            And you said you were doin' it, you're doin' it, you're doin' it
            You say that what you're doin', you're doin', you're doin'
            You told me that what, what you're doin', you're doin', you're doin'
            What would you do?
            If your brother left you, what would you do?
            If them niggas came for you, you better pursue (Watch out)
            I just spent ten racks on a dog from Germany, no Purdue
            Oops, I meant Dupri, jewelry sitting on A/C

            I got the show, fuck my show, be my show (What)
            I got them loafs, I'm with Metro, he got some more (Yeah)
            I don't gotta talk, look at my jewelry, it can say more, hey
            You smoke that kushy, man I'm so goody, I want some cookies
            Fuck on your daughter, fuck on my brother, now she gon' diss you
            I got them racks, I was just buyin', you was just lookin'
            I bought her diamonds and she just smilin', she think she's tooken
            But, this for the love of my fans
            I'm smokin' pot while in Japan
            Blacker the berry, drink my cran
            Bae you dig it and I'm the sand (Dig)

            Humming
            
            [Refrain]
            Well this is why-a-why-a-why
            Well this is why-a-why-a-why
            Well this is why-a-why-a-why
