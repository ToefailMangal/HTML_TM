        <h2>Producer</h2>

        <p>
            Leland Tyler Wayne (born September 16, 1993), known professionally as Metro Boomin, is an American record producer and songwriter. Known for his dark production style, he is regarded as one of the most influential producers in modern hip hop and trap music. His frequent collaborators include Big Sean, Future, Young Thug, The Weeknd, Travis Scott, Don Toliver, 21 Savage, Gucci Mane, Gunna, and Nav.

            Raised in St. Louis, Missouri, Wayne began his career in music production in 2009 at the age of 16.[2] He relocated to Atlanta to attend Morehouse College in 2011, during which he worked extensively with Atlanta-based artists including Future, Young Thug, 21 Savage, Gucci Mane, and Migos.[2] Wayne gained wider recognition for co-producing the 2014 single "Tuesday" for iLoveMakonnen, which peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100. He was credited on a string of similarly successful singles throughout 2016, including "Jumpman" by Drake and Future, "Low Life" by Future, and his first number one production, "Bad and Boujee" by Migos. This was followed by "Congratulations" by Post Malone, "Tunnel Vision" by Kodak Black, "Mask Off" by Future, "Bank Account" by 21 Savage, and his second number one production, "Heartless" by the Weeknd.[3][4]</a>.
