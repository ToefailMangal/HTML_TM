            And she the best with that head
            Even better than Karrine
            She don't want money
            She want the time that we could spend
            She said, "'Cause I really need somebody
            So tell me you're that somebody"
            Girl, I fuck who I want, and fuck who I don't
            Got that A1 credit, that's that filet mignon
            She said, "I never want to make you mad
            I just want to make you proud"
            I said, "Baby, just make me cum
            Then don't make a sound"
