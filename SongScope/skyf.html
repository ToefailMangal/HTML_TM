            [Intro: Travis Scott]
            Ooh, ah
            Ooh, ooh, ooh, ah
            Ooh, ah, ooh, ooh, ah
            Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah
            
            [Chorus: Travis Scott]
            I'm trapped in my conscious
            My trap is still bunkin', look at all these hundreds
            Hit up the hood pharmacist, he serve all the muddy
            Might shoot at your buddy who shot at my buddy
            The sky keep on fallin', the drugs I keep callin'
            They keep pickin' up for me, they love me
            
            [Refrain: Travis Scott]
            I don't wanna buy, oh no
            It won't get me high, oh no
            
            [Chorus: Travis Scott]
            I'm trapped in my conscious
            My trap is still bunky, look at all of these hundreds
            Hit up the hood pharmacist, he serve all the muddy
            Might shoot at your buddy who shot at my buddy
            The sky keep on fallin', the drugs keep on callin'
            
            [Bridge: Travis Scott]
            Yeah, that's that loud shit, yeah
            I been out on my latest trip
            I've been drunk in my latest whip
            So I might crash in ass, for real (For real, for real)
            
            [Verse 1: Travis Scott]
            Hit the club for the cougars
            I never got down with the morals of Martin Luther
            I'm just tryna ball, why these niggas want me neutered?
            Got her down to her drawers, tryna get a little nuder
            They just wanna hang like my nigga Mr. Cooper
            I'm so 'head of my time, could I show up any sooner?
            They said I fucked the roommates, oh, you know that just a rumor
            Have you ever got stoned with your motherfuckin' jeweler? (Jeweler)
            Scott La Flame, no Rick the Ruler (Ruler), yeah
            
            [Refrain: Travis Scott]
            I don't wanna buy no more (No more)
            Your shit ain't gettin' me high no more (No more)
            
            [Pre-Chorus: Travis Scott]
            My trap is still bunky, look at all of these hundreds
            Might jump with no bungee, I'm gone off that muddy
            The drugs keep—
            
            [Chorus: Travis Scott]
            I'm trapped in my conscious (Ooh)
            My trap is still bunky, look at all of these hundreds (Ah)
            Might jump with no bungee, get lost in the muddy (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ah)
            I might shoot at your buddy who shot at my buddy (Ooh, ah)
            Where's the love if you love me?
            And the sky keep on fallin', the drugs I keep callin' (Ooh, ooh)
            They keep pickin' up for me (Ah), they love me
            
            
            [Refrain: Travis Scott]
            I don't wanna buy no more (No more)
            Your shit ain't gettin' me high no more
            
            [Chorus: Travis Scott]
            I'm trapped in my conscious
            My trap is still bunky, look at all of these hundreds
            Might jump with no bungee, I'm gone off that muddy
            The drugs keep on callin', the sky keep on fallin'
            
            [Bridge: Young Thug]
            The drugs keep on callin' (Callin')
            The sky keep on fallin', the drugs keep on callin'
            The sky keep on fallin' (On fallin')
            The drugs keep on callin', the sky keep on fallin' (Fallin')
            The sky keep on fallin' (Fallin')
            The drugs keep on callin', the sky keep on fallin' (Fallin')
            The sky keep on fallin' (Fallin')
            The drugs keep on callin', the sky keep on fallin' (Keep on fallin')
            
            [Refrain: Young Thug & Travis Scott]
            (Ooh, ah)
            Look me inside of my eyes (Ooh, ah)
            (Ooh, ah)
            All of this pain, but I'm tryna disguise (Ooh, ah)
            
            
            [Verse 2: Young Thug & Travis Scott]
            I'm it, like a game that get played by a kid
            Pussy boy, I'm on your head like a wig
            Diamonds water like I bought 'em from a squid
            A1s, what she get when she want dick
            Black diamonds like I'm Akon kid
            Whippin', I can turn a two to a six
            Real talk, on Blood, you dead (Ooh, ah, ooh, ooh, ah)
            And I still want that head like a lid
            Hit the school, make it rain on a principal
            I will leave a nigga smokin' like an Optimo
            All my bitches, they on green, go
            They ridin' with heat, ready to sting, bro
            I got three hundred bitches like I'm Sosa, ho (Ooh, ah, ooh, ooh, ah)
            My jewelry shinin' like some Mop & Glo
            Inside her pants is a camel toe
            I swear I fell in love with all those (Ooh, ah, ooh, ooh, ah)
            
            [Refrain: Travis Scott]
            I don't wanna buy no more (No more)
            Your shit ain't gettin' me high no more (No more)
            
            [Pre-Chorus: Travis Scott]
            My trap is still bunky, look at all of these hundreds
            Might jump with no bungee, I'm gone off that muddy
            The drugs keep—
            
            [Chorus: Travis Scott]
            I'm trapped in my conscious (Ooh, ah)
            My trap is still bunky, look at all of these hundreds
            Might jump with no bungee, get lost in the muddy (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ah)
            I might shoot at your buddy who shot at my buddy (Ooh)
            Where's the love if you love me? (Ah)
            And the sky keep on fallin', the drugs I keep callin' (Ooh, ooh)
