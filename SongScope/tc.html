            I mastered math like white collars, B
            Open your mouth like you yawning
            Double cup featuring Barney
            I'm with the dogs and we barking
            I'ma take off like a Martian
            Fuck her and leave her my mark in
            Bust on that hoe, I'm just markin'
            Look at these niggas, they markers
            Ready for war like a Spartan
            You can't block me like I'm Marshawn
            My bro got a sound like a marker
            
            [Chorus]

            Broke nigga, stop that madness
            And you hoes need to stop that scrambling (Yeah)
            Living two minutes from bando
            Trip on these hoes, make 'em panic
            I did 'em wrong and I meant it
            New Derrick Rose and I'm winnin'
            About these fuckboys, I'm relentless
            I'm tryna put my nut in you really
            I'm tryna put my butt in some skinnies
            I'm charging my bitch a new Bentley, ayy

            You got me stopping at the green light, light, yeah
            I'll set you good, I'm off a bean, right
            And I know you want a savage to give you a ring, right?
