            [Chorus: Travis Scott & Sean Kingston]
We wake up when the sun goes down
Neighbor says the smell's too loud
Ridin' in my old-school thing
Shotgun with my old-school babe
So wake me when the sun goes down
Tonight's my last night in town
I pledge to a flag so grey
No matter what time, the skies are grey

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Ooh, around this time, was starving, no Ramadan
Yeah, might've robbed you blind, you, you, you, your dad and moms
Yeah, keep that in mind, fear two things, being broke and dying
Yeah, jump your ass inside, LSD, come take this ride
No A-C-I-D, how you get your ass inside
Yeah, take one peek at me, you might get lost in my mind
Yeah, fuck that college shit, that scholarship, let's hypnotize (Grey)
Yeah, ooh (Uh)

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
We wake up when the sun goes down
Neighbor says the smell's too loud
Ridin' in my old-school thing
Shotgun with my old-school babe
So wake me when the sun goes down
Tonight's my last night in town
I pledge to a flag so grey (No matter what time)
No matter what time, the skies are grey

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
(Grey)
Yeah, oh (Grey)
Yeah (Grey)
Yeah, oh (Uh-huh, grey)
The sky is grey (Grey)
Mmm-mm-mm (Grey)
Mmm-mm-mm (Grey)
The sky is grey (Uh-huh)
Woah (Grey)
Yeah, yeah (Grey)
Woah (Grey)
Yeah, yeah (Uh-huh)
The sky is grey
Yeah, yeah, the sky is grey
Mmm, ooh (Grey)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Might be the last time I trip
I know I said this shit last time, but damn, I never had a trip like this
Who knew a threeway on freeway
Can trip with three hoes to a six-way?
Ain't gotta finesse out the midway
So Bird can wrap birds in that Ben-Gay
No more, goddamn
And pops never gave me shit
But pops ain't raised no bitch
I swung, I missed, he swung, he hit, then I hit that ditch
Raised in a town where they looked so good outside like it ain't that serious
My nigga got dumb years doing dumb shit
Locked up in the car, had to pull a gun quick
Killer tatted on his face, leaked to his conscious
Now he stuck in a cell, know he feeling nauseous
The nigga so good, he was so cold
Another lost kid, Mo City soul


[Outro: Travis Scott]
The sky is grey, woah, go
Mmm, mmm, yeah
