            [Intro]
Don't serve her, don't serve her, don't serve her
Don't serve her, don't serve her, don't serve
(Metro Boomin want some more, nigga)

[Chorus]
Back hitting licks, back on that dirty (Straight up)
Cuzzo back on the block, he back servin' birdies (That dope)
Plug hit my switch, damn, he woke me up early (Oh no)
If that bitch smell like Swiss, oh, no, no, no, don't serve her (Straight up)
Back hitting licks, back on that dirty (La Flame)
Cuzzo back on the block, he back servin' birdies (Straight up)
Plug hit my switch, damn, he woke me up early (Oh no)
If that bitch smell like Swiss, oh, no, no, no, don't serve her

[Verse]
Blackout, nigga, deeper than a frat house, nigga
Doper than the crack house, nigga (Straight up)
20/20 Lambo', new edition
Gotta hit two gears just to back out, nigga (La Flame)
Been a hell of a night, but hell of a dykes cost a hell of a price (Straight up)
With a devil in a new dress on the thirty-fifth floor, nigga
Goddamn, that's a hell of a sight (Oh no)
Damn right that is, damn right, she drowned my kids
Damn right, don't doubt, damn right
Damn right, I hit it, anything I said, I did it
Damn right, only roll that gas, don't pass that midget
Treat a pint like a handle (Straight up)
When I'm with your girl, I hit your girl in the bando (La Flame)
Know I go commando
Know I need my cheese, know my cheese, know the nachos (Skrrt)
Fall back, back, back, when you see me
You can fall back when you see me tweakin' (Straight up)
Throw that ass back, back, back, back, know a nigga might throw that ticket (La Flame)

[Bridge]
Feds hit my block, it got hot (Woo)
But I'm back up in this bitch and I can't stop (Straight up, woo)

[Chorus]
Back hitting licks (Woo), back on that dirty
Cuzzo back on the block, he back servin' birdies (That dope)
Plug hit my switch, damn, he woke me up early (Oh no)
If that bitch smell like Swiss, oh, no, no, no, don't serve her (Straight up)
Back hitting licks, back on that dirty (Oh no)
Cuzzo back on the block, he back servin' birdies (La Flame)
Plug hit my switch, damn, he woke me up early (Oh no)
If that bitch smell like Swiss, oh, no, no, no, don't serve her (Straight up)
