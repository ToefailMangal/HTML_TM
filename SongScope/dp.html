            [Intro: Matty Healy]
Drink slow to feed the nose, you know he likes to get blown
Has he got enough money to spend?
Leave? No, he's to and fro, he doesn't like it when the girls go
Has he got enough money to spend?

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
I ain't playin' with these niggas
I ain't playin' with, I ain't playin' with these niggas (Straight up)
I ain't playin' with these niggas
I ain't playin' with, I ain't playin' with these niggas (Straight up)
I ain't playin' with these niggas (Oh no)
I ain't playin' with, I ain't playin' with these niggas (La Flame)
I ain't playin' with these niggas (Straight up, straight up)
I ain't playin' with, I ain't playin' with these niggas

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Know I need my dollars
Know a nigga need my commas (Straight up)
She was down when I dropped out of college
Down, she was down when I rode Impalas (Slay)
Played with her pussy in the Jeep
Yeah, she was down with the foreplay drivin' (Oh no)
Jumped in the car when she hit my digits
Don't want nothin', just to pull up at the projects (Skrrt)
Easy to me, my nigga
Villa with a scene, youngin always seen with a killer (Straight up)
Hand-stitched by my dealer
Dealing with a seam you ain't seen, what you mean, Margiela? (La Flame)
Shit, he got the 'scripts for the cough
In the H, gotta hit Johnny for the frost, swerved off
Ain't it been a minute since they seen a weird nigga from the corner put it on for the south? (Straight up)
On my mama, know a nigga be coastin' (Bless up)
Go, nigga, go, nigga, grab my bottles
Go, nigga, go, nigga, grab my chronic (Bando)
Keep ya head, head, my nigga
Niggas gon' be billionaires, my nigga (Straight up)
Fuck how much time that shit might take
Niggas ain't playin' with 'em (Playin' with 'em, playin' with 'em, playin' with 'em)
