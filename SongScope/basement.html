[Intro]
Yo, uh
Got my nigga Easy in this motherfucker
Deadstock sixes and shit
Got my nigga Metro in this motherfucker, yeah, ooh

[Verse 1]
Uh, by the bar (Bar), buy the bar
Bitches on my table everywhere (Where), on the floor
Condoms on my dresser (Straight up), on my business (Business)
Never plannin', never sober thinking (La Flame)
Blew me up (Up), body shots took on your bitches titties (La Flame)
Slow it down, pick it up, fuck a third speed
The fourth gear grindin' up on everything, it's my year (Straight up)
I got it now, everything I ever asked for
We gettin' it, far from mama Jeep, she never tinted it
She frozed up, I unfrozed her
Now come a little closer (Straight up)
Get your ass up off that wall and go and roll up that doja (That dough)
Tell your boyfriend bust that ki', go 'head and fill your nose up (La Flame)
'Til it's over
We ain't lookin' for the hoes, where the trophies?
Grab a glass, go ahead, get throwed up (Yeah, yeah, straight up)
She feelin' it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Don't spill the shit (Yeah, yeah)
Ah, she crazy, she goin', she goin', gone

[Chorus]
Ayy, all this money on the table, ooh
We don't want relations
We don't want no conversations
Fuck around and change the weather (Straight up)
Damn, I'm with my main bitch
Ayy, and I don't love her no more (No, no, no, no, no, no, no)
Drinkin', fuck the limitations
I done made it out the basement
Fuck around and change the weather (Straight up)
Ayy

[Verse 2]
I'm off a bean, I'm off a bean
See this lean, it's in my dreams (That dope)
Off this dope, don't wanna smoke (Oh no)
Off this roll, I might just roll (Straight up, straight up)
Let's get throwed
Out in Houston, they know my name (Oh)
In MO city, they know the gang (Oh)
Young La Flame, ain't nothin' changed
But the chains and diamond rings
Diamond rings, I lost my brains
Me and Ye Ye out in broad day
I'm on the third coast
Eatin' Burlow with Merlot (Straight up)
I got my shirt off
Kickin' dirt off out in Bergdorf (La Flame)
She like, "What you doin'?" (Doin')
It took a path just to get me here, don't give a damn if that's ruined (Ruined)
Later on, got a ring, ring, ring
She at my doorbell, "Ding-ding-ding-ding"
Let the bitch in, the bitch seen
Bang out, bang out
On the couch, on the floor, in her mouth
Cameras out (Cameras out)
Once my dick's in, no pullin' out (No pullin' out)
That's my baby (Straight up)
Bitch been doing coke since the '80s (That dope)
Ooh, I'm a '90s baby (La Flame)
Young La Flame, you know he crazy (Straight up, straight up)


[Chorus]
Ayy, all this money on the table, ooh
We don't want relations
We don't want no conversations
Fuck around and change the weather
Damn, I'm with my main bitch
Ayy, and I don't love her no more
Drinkin', fuck the limitations
I done made it out the basement
Fuck around and change the weather
Ayy
