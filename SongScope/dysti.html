            [Intro]
            (Hoo) Yawa thgin eht esahc
            Ot ydaer 'nitteg er'uoy wonk I
            Ecnad annaw uoy wonk I, evom annaw uoy wonk I
            Doom eht ni enola emoh er'uoy nehw
            
            [Chorus]
            I try it if it feels right
            This feels nice
            I've been down and lost for days
            Glad I found you on the way
            When the day gets brighter, the night gets nighter
            I always feel this way
            Through the hills
            I hear you callin', miles and miles away
            (Hoo) Yawa thgin eht esahc
            Ot ydaer 'nitteg erâ€™uoy wonk I
            Ecnad annaw uoy wonk I ,evom annaw uoy wonk I
            Doom eht ni enola emoh er'uoy nehw
            
            [Verse]
            We up all night, from dawn to dusk, it's always poppin'
            I fell in love, fell outta love, we both had options
            I played the drums, she rolled the drugs
            I rocked the club, we both throw up
            We was the band you never heard before
            You got that tat' above your crack
            And on your cat, you be right back
            Your mama never know
            We were rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' stones
            When I'm all alone I wish you had a clone
            I take that puff, you take that puff
            You know we never care to overdose

            [Chorus]
            I try it if it feels right (Oh)
            This feels nice
            I've been down and lost for days
            Glad I found you on the way
            When the day gets brighter, the night gets nighter
            I always feel this way
            Through the hills
            I hear you callin', miles and miles away
            (Hoo) Yawa thgin eht esahc
            Ot ydaer 'nitteg er'uoy wonk I
            Ecnad annaw uoy wonk I, evom annaw uoy wonk I
            Doom eht ni enola emoh er'uoy nehw
            
            [Bridge]
            Shit, I try it if it feels nice
            Shit, this kinda feels nice
            M-miles and miles away
            Miles and miles away
            
            [Outro]
            When you're home alone in the mood
            I know you wanna move, I know you wanna dance
            I know you gettin' ready to
            Take the night away
            When you're home alone in the mood
            I know you wanna move, I know you wanna dance
            I know you're gettin' ready to
            Chase the night away (Ooh)
            Oh, you love me, darling
