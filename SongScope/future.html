        <h1>Future</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>HipHop/Trap artist</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Nayvadius DeMun Cash[8] (né Wilburn; born November 20, 1983), known professionally as Future, is an American rapper,
             singer-songwriter, and record producer. Known for his mumble-styled vocals and prolific output,
              Future is considered a pioneer of the use of Auto-Tuned melodies in trap music.
              Due to the sustained popularity of this musical style, he is commonly regarded as one of the most influential rappers of his generation.</a>
               <br>
              Born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, Future signed a recording contract with Rocko's A1 Recordings in 2011,
            which entered a joint venture with Epic Records shortly after. His first two studio albums,
            Pluto (2012) and Honest (2014), were both met with critical and commercial success,
            spawning the platinum-certified singles "Turn On the Lights", "Honest", "Move That Dope" (featuring Pharrell Williams and Pusha T), and "I Won" (featuring Kanye West).
            His subsequent albums have each debuted atop the US Billboard 200; his third and fourth, DS2 (2015) and Evol (2016), were supported by the singles "Where Ya At" (featuring Drake) and "Low Life" (featuring the Weeknd),
            respectively. Future's eponymous fifth album and its follow-up, Hndrxx (both 2017) made him the first musical act to release two chart-topping projects on the Billboard 200 in consecutive weeks—the former spawned his first Billboard Hot 100-top ten single, "Mask Off."</a>.
