            [Intro]
            Ayy
            We got London On Da Track
            Ayy
            
            [Pre-Chorus]
            Rose gold Rolex, who you are
            They don't know, who you are
            Vroom, adiós, I steer a foreign car, ho
            Shawty mine, finesse her right out her barcode
            She get clean like Windex when she want to
            She can read a nigga's texts when she want to
            No tats up on your shirt, she'll never want you
            Hop out the Benz coupe
            
            [Chorus]
            Fuck me, suck me
            L-O-V-E, do you love me?
            In the tubby, poppin' bubbly
            Smokin' musty, I love me
            Love, lo-lo-love, love, love, love me
            Fall deep in love, love, love with me
            Baby girl come suck me and fuck me
            Drankin' bubbly, we get thuggish and rugged
            
            [Refrain]
            Tell 'em who you are
            Don't you know who we are?
            These women know who we are
            Plenty Benjamins on me and my squad
            When you a prince, nigga, your doors ajar
            Actin' like you don't know who we are, but you do
            I know you know who she was
            Twerk it, babe, real slow-motion, slow
            See rap shows near Rotterdam

            Money green like camouflage
            STD, I'm takin' over your ward
            Homegirl fine, body smooth and all
            Planned on havin' more kids than God, damn
            I turned up her closet, now she look like a Barbie
            Now my drinks are clean, I fill 'em up with that oil
            Bumped my self esteem and now I think I'm adored
            Let me in the door or else I'll come through the walls (Walls)
            I haven't lied in days, for you
            Treatin' myself like I got AIDS for you
            I ain't fuck none of these lil' girls like I got AIDS for you, ayy
            I got nine lives, I'll blaze for you
            I'll set it down in days for you
            Shawty pubics, shaved
            Her eyes hazel, too
