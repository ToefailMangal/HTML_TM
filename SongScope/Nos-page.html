            [Intro]
            You know how we be rocking, ya heard
            
            [Verse 1]
            Bright light shining all bright on the Bentley
            Work the Cadillac, panoramic, no panties
            Old school Chevy '55 granddaddy
            Gotta throw some salt on it, 'cause you know I'm getting at it
            Throw the fork on it, then put it in traffic
            Throw the sauce on it, got it flying out of Dallas
            Hope you didn't do it to yourself, that's tragic
            Hope you didn't throw away what we established
            Hope you wouldn't turn your back on your family
            The way a nigga look 'round here, they'll back stab you
            Word from your motherfuckin' brother, young nigga
            I just wanna see you happy, I just wanna see you happy
            Comin' through the cut, like a known Grim Reaper
            'Bout to get it straight finessed, tryna get a little cheaper
            Hold on to that clip, like a doped up needle
            Girl hang on that strip with a four Desert Eagle
            
            [Chorus]
            Known to put a bad little bitch in some red bottoms
            Ayy, where ya mans at? Heard that the feds got 'em
            I seen you cruise the Land Rover through the west side
            Gold Rolex, better check your peripheral
            It's a full moon in the middle of the day
            Got them wolves out, rock a little Cartier
            Got the trap jammed packed like The Masquerade
            Know a few real ones ain't gon' see they next birthday
            Tell them young niggas grind 'fore you gon' knock someone down, if they gon' shoot, then shoot something
            We better hear 'bout this shit on the news or somethin'
            We better hear 'bout this shit on the news or somethin'
            Man down over yonder, young came through holdin' on the cane like a drummer
            They done took a boss out, nigga, no wonder
            Niggas gettin' crossed out, nigga, no wonder
            Hoes gettin' X'd out and we on ganja
            The police wanna talk, but we won't say nothin'
            True to these clips, niggas won't say nothin'
            Niggas true to these clips, niggas won't say nothin'
            
            [Verse 2]
            Had the Parkay jumpin' out the Pyrex
            High definition glass on my pinky finger
            Niggas swimmin' in the water, no paddle
            Niggas trying to walk in my shadow
            The bird on the bezel, I'm a well known rebel
            Told the young nigga, "Freebandz, Roc-A-Fella"
            Told a young nigga, "Freebandz, Roc-A-Fella"
            You can turn this off and I can kick it acapella
            We work the Front Street, where Mama said, "Don't go," we went there
            Trap house embalmed with that crack, then we went there
            Shawty don't fuck with these folks, these niggas be tellin' these days, be tellin' these days
            
            [Chorus]
            Known to put a bad little bitch in some red bottoms
            Ayy, where ya mans at? Heard that the feds got 'em
            I seen you cruise the Land Rover through the west side
            Gold Rolex, better check your peripheral
            It's a full moon in the middle of the day
            Got them wolves out, rock a little Cartier
            Got the trap jammed packed like The Masquerade
            Know a few real ones ain't gon' see they next birthday
            Tell them young niggas grind 'fore you gon' knock someone down, if they gon' shoot, then shoot something
            We better hear 'bout this shit on the news or somethin'
            We better hear 'bout this shit on the news or somethin'
            Man down over yonder, young came through holdin' on the cane like a drummer
            They done took a boss out, nigga, no wonder

            True to these clips, niggas won't say nothin'
            Niggas true to these clips, niggas won't say nothin'
            [Outro]
            Niggas true to these clips, niggas won't say nothin'
            Known to put a bad little bitch in some red bottoms
            Ayy, where ya mans at? Heard that the feds got 'em
