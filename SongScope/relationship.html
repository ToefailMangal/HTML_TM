            [Chorus: Future]
            I'm in a relationship with all my bitches, yeah
            I need to cut some of 'em off, I need help
            I got some bad tings, I want her to myself
            Had to take the time to cut 'em off, I need help
            I know how to make the girls go crazy
            When you treat her like your number one baby
            Put my bitches on yachts, we don't do jet-skis
            Put your ice on rocks, they need to help me
            
            [Verse 1: Future & Young Thug]
            No baby, your collection, won't stand for it
            You know you're in relationship with all us
            I get a few texts a day sayin', "It's all yours"
            I got a few states on speed dial like good drugs
            Get in your bag, uh, yeah, get in your bag, uh
            Hundred new purse for a brat, uh
            Comin' down the street, new Jag (Skrrt)
            Turbo bitch 'bout to drag, nigga had M's 'fore ass
            Got a brand new bitch, who that?
            Rock the flooded AP, all black
            White toes, get me a tan, cocaine, killing time
            All a bitch wanna do is shine, Audemars, pick which kind
            I made you a starter, you went from a dime to a quarter
            I Chico DeBarge it, I'm leaving that loud in apartments, yeah
            Don't play with a sergeant (Ah), I'm ready to spoil it (Ah)
            She suck on my dick (Yeah), I'm hidin' in the closet (Uh)
            I'm higher than the moon, three mil' in the room
            You get silver spoon, I bought you some goons

            I got your bitch in a backpack
            I paid extra for the crib, it got a kid shack
            I paid extra for the crib, it got a game room
            Got a penthouse in the back, it ain't my main room
            Tamika, Jo and Porsche they kept it silent
            That's the only reason I let 'em fly private
