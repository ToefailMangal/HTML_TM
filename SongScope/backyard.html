            [Intro]
            Aight, play the shit
            Yuh, yuh
            Yeah
            
            [Verse 1]
            Gon' grab that fifth, grab that eighth, grab what you need
            Blow that dope, don't get too high
            From the Third Coast to the West Coast, come, take this ride
            Let me tell the tale of how Jacques turned Scott
            Over one lost trip to the sky
            Let me tell the tale 'cause you told the tale
            When you said I could make it this high
            Who knew?
            Goddammit, who knew?
            The grass ain't greener on the other side, it's just blue
            You can really identify when you lookin' in they eyes
            Who ready to ride, that's true
            When they look in my eyes, they see that real
            How Scotty entired that juice, had my back against that wall
            Every summer felt so cold, my daddy ain't comin' home 'til fall
            That's why my pimp game's so moist, had that du-rag and all
            Had a twenty-year-old bitch in high school
            Wasn't no tellin' what Travy might do
            On the south side of that H-O-U
            Hol' up, let's take it back to that room, no car, but still had drive
            Just a hundred niggas standin' outside
            Life's a beach with lot of sand on the lot
            I'ma ride for all of my niggas, they forever here by my side
            It was just eight niggas in a two bedroom, no leg room, that was last June, yeah, yeah, for real

            [Pre-Chorus]
            Yeah, yeah, for real
            Fuck what they talkin' 'bout if they ain't talkin' 'bout me, nigga
            Let it be known, yeah, it's that real
            Yeah, yeah, for real
            For real
            Fuck what they talkin' 'bout if they ain't talkin' 'bout
            We the niggas everybody talkin' 'bout, it's that real
            Yeah, for real
            
            [Chorus]
            Backyard, we chillin', backyard, we drinkin', smokin'
            Homie brought out the liquor, backyard, we gettin' high
            Back-backyard, we chillin', back-backyard, we smokin', drinkin'
            Back-backyard, we gettin' high
            Backyard, we chillin', backyard, we drinkin', smokin'
            Homie brought out the liquor, backyard, we gettin' high
            Back-backyard, we chillin', back-backyard, we smokin', drinkin'
            Back-backyard, we gettin' high
            
            [Verse 2]
            Verses, one day you'll find your purpose
            Now, my show's packed out like churches
            Fans never missin' out a word on the verses (Now)
            Never sit around, just workin' (Now), it was worth it (Now)
            Once for certain (Now), I deserve it (Now)
            Lord knows we don't get tired, been through more dirt than a derby
            Mama worked for AT&T and we still ain't get that service
            She stayed in, out the hospital, you know that made me nervous (Uh)
            Still step out the house to smell so fresh, fresh like detergent, uh
            If a bitch don't want me, don't need them, still got my Jergens
            And bitch, you can keep them herpes
            Go alert me
            No house light on, cop light on, fuck this journey
            You heard me, you heard me, now, swervin', hittin' curbs and
            And my nigga, my nigga came home, so it just got real
            
            
            [Pre-Chorus]
            Yeah, yeah, for real
            Fuck what they talkin' 'bout if they ain't talkin' 'bout me, nigga
            Let it be known, yeah, it's that real
            Yeah, yeah, for real
            For real
            Fuck what they talkin' 'bout if they ain't talkin' 'bout
            We the niggas everybody talkin' 'bout, it's that real
            Yeah, for real
            
            [Chorus]
            Backyard, we chillin', backyard, we drinkin', smokin'
            Homie brought out the liquor, backyard, we gettin' high
            Back-backyard, we chillin', back-backyard, we smokin', drinkin'
            Back-backyard, we gettin' high
            Backyard, we chillin', backyard, we drinkin', smokin'
            Homie brought out the liquor, backyard, we gettin' high
            Back-backyard, we chillin', back-backyard, we smokin', drinkin'
            Back-backyard, we gettin' high
