            Caleb Zackery "Don" Toliver[2] (/ˈtɒlɪvər/ TOL-iv-ər; born June 12, 1994) is an American rapper and singer-songwriter. His debut mixtape, Donny Womack (2018) was released a day prior to fellow Houston rapper Travis Scott's album Astroworld (2018), on which Toliver guest appeared on its song "Can't Say".[3] In the following week, he signed with Scott's record label, Cactus Jack Records, in a joint venture with Atlantic Records.

            As a lead artist, he gained wider recognition for his 2019 single, "No Idea" and his 2020 single "After Party", both of which entered the Billboard Hot 100 and received triple platinum certifications by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Both songs first gained viral popularity on the video-hosting service TikTok,[4] and preceded his debut studio album, Heaven or Hell (2020). Met with favorable critical reception, it peaked within the top ten of the Billboard 200 along with his second and third albums, Life of a Don (2021) and Love Sick (2023). He guest appeared alongside Nav and Gunna on Internet Money's 2020 single "Lemonade", which peaked within the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100. His trap-centered fourth studio album, Hardstone Psycho (2024) peaked at number three on the Billboard 200 and was led by the top 40 single, "Bandit".        </a>.
