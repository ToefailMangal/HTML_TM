            [Verse 1: Young Thug]
            Twist it like a Tootsie Roll, Roll, Roll
            Like a movie play your fuckin' role, role, role
            Can't believe my circle small like Cheerios
            Hate to say it, but it saved another Bankroll
            She tryna pop it all for me
            Lil shawty tryna drop it all for me
            But I see right through her body
            That she just want her money, she not vibin'
            And if you look, that shit is what I'm poppin'
            I left you with a brick, better re-rock it
            Fucked her good, and now her heart is in my pocket
            Ha-uh, ha-uh, ha-uh
            Her heart beatin', mind racin', but we gotta pace it
            Sit on my face, that pussy wet like she fresh out the lake, and
            I milked this place, I beat the case, crank up my generator
            I got some X, I got some syrup, I'm smokin' turtle tank, and
            See rap shows near Rotterdam
            Get tickets as low as $73
